# Graphs

## Graphs OOP (JAVA)

this project deals with creation and representation of directed weighted graphs

draw graphs in a graphic window

and find shortest paths

# classes:

  #### Node (use for the graph implementation)
  #### Edge (use for the graph implementation)
  #### DGraph (represent a directed weighted graph)
  #### Graph_Algo (initialized by a graph and enable execute algorithms)
  #### Graph_Draw (shows the graph in a graphic window)
  #### GraphTest (class for testing the grpah methods , algorithms and graphic)


Graph_Algo and the graph classes implements Serializable 
and allow to initialize Graph_Algo from a file which contains graph object
and also write graph object in to a file
